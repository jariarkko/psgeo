Abstract

   Activity JSON is a simple format that allows providing information
   about activities and their geographic positions.  It is an extension
   of existing formats, specialized to provide some additional
   information that applications can use to perform filtering, showing
   useful information to the user, and so on.  Activity JSON is
   primarily targeted towards passing information between a web server
   and an application running in a browser.

1.  Introduction

   The author has worked with web applications that deal with sports
   activities in different locations.  The applications allow displaying
   varying activities on a map, smart filtering based on specific type
   or attributes of those activities.

   Activity JSON is a simple format that allows providing information
   about activities and their geographic positions.  It is an extension
   of existing formats, specialized to provide some additional
   information that applications can use to perform filtering, showing
   useful information to the user, and so on.  Activity JSON is
   primarily targeted towards passing information between a web server
   and an application running in a browser.

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] is a popular format used
   in web applications.  GeoJSON [RFC7946] [GeoJSON] is a format for
   encoding a variety of geographic data structures using JSON.

   Activity JSON has been used in building websites for skiing-related
   activities reported in [Planetskier] and caving-related activities
   reported in [Luolaseura] and [Planetcaver].

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 3
   describes the currently specified format for Activity JSON.  The
   description includes specification of the syntax rules and the
   structure as inherited from base specifications, and a detailed
   discussion of the specific properties that can be described by
   Activity JSON objects.

   There are, however, two older versions of Activity JSON.  Software
   libraries support all format variants, so using an older format is
   generally ok, but for new information the Generation 2 format is
   RECOMMENDED.  Note that with Generation 2 format, Activity JSON can
   be directly supplied to a wide variety of software that accepts
   GeoJSON.  The earlier format generations and compatibility discussion
   can be found in Section 4, Section 5, and Section 6.

2.  Normative Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Generation 2 Format

   The format is a specialization of GeoJSON.  Every Activity JSON
   object is also a valid GeoJSON object, but has some extra properties
   to carry the information that is needed to describe the activities.

   For example, an empty file contains just:

             {
               "type": "FeatureCollection",
               "features": []
             }

   Here's an example of a file with just one entry:

      {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": [
            {
              "type": "Feature",
              "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [60.30145486, 24.62792567] },
              "properties": {
                "n": "Kattilajaerven iso lippaluola, Nuuksio, Espoo",
                "m": "https://example.com/cavemap-kattilajarvi.pdf",
                "l": 9.3,
                "la": "exact",
                "k": "Espoo",
                "c": "Finland",
                "o": "Europe",
                "rl": [{ "t": "Kattilajaervi roof caves",
                         "i": "https://example.com/kattilajarvi-pic.jpg"
                         "w": ["Jari"],
                         "y": 2020,
                         "m": 5,
                         "a": ["Caving"],
                         "sa": ["Rock"],
                         "u": "https://example.com/kattilajarvi-article.html" }
                      ]
               }
            }
        ]
      }

4.  Generation 1 Format

   The format is based on JSON.  An Activity JSON Generation 1 object
   MUST be a JSON array of records.

   For example, an empty file contains just:

             []

   Here's an example of a file with just one entry:

        [
         {"n": "Kattilajaerven iso lippaluola, Nuuksio, Espoo",
          "lat": 60.30145486,
          "lon": 24.62792567,
          "m": "https://example.com/cavemap-kattilajarvi.pdf",
          "l": 9.3,
          "la": "exact",
          "k": "Espoo",
          "c": "Finland",
          "o": "Europe",
          "rl": [{ "t": "Kattilajaervi roof caves",
                   "i": "https://example.com/kattilajarvi-pic.jpg"
                   "w": ["Jari"],
                   "y": 2020,
                   "m": 5,
                   "a": ["Caving"],
                   "sa": ["Rock"],
                   "u": "https://example.com/kattilajarvi-article.html" }
                ]
         }
        ]

   Where the fields are as follows:

   n

      The name of the place.  By convention the last item of the name
      (after last comma) should be city name.  Mandatory.

   lat, lon

      The coordinates, in WGS84 format.  Mandatory.

   alt

      An optional attribute that describes the altitude the location or
      the highest point in the destination, in memeters.

   fz

      Set to true if the coordinates are "fuzzy" to hide the true
      location for privacy etc. reasons.  Default is false.  This
      attribute is optional.

   m

      The cave map link URL, if any.  If there's no URL, the attribute
      should not be specified at all (and should not be set to, e.g.,

      empty string, although it is recommended that software recognises
      empty strings similarly to missing attributes.

   l

      The length of the cave in meters, if known.  The attribute is
      optional, and should be left out if no value is known.

   la

      The cave length accuracy ("exact" or "approx").  The attribute is
      optional, and the default value is "approx" if no other value is
      provided.

   k

      The city/town/county.  This attribute is mandatory.

   c

      The country.  This attribute is mandatory.

   o

      The continent.  This attribute is mandatory.

   rl

      The "reading list", a list of articles describing visits etc.
      This can of course be empty, i.e., [], but the attribute itself is
      mandatory.

   Where each article has the following fields:

   t

      The title.  This attribute is mandatory.

   i

      URL for an image representing the article.  This attribute is
      optional.  If no image URL known, the attribute should not be
      specified at all.

   w

      List of people who were there.  This attribute is mandatory.

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


   y

      Year of visit (as a number).  This attribute is mandatory.

   m

      The month of visit (as a number, between 1-12).  This attribute is
      mandatory.

   a

      The activity: Caving, Skiing, etc.  This attribute is mandatory.

   sa

      The sub-activity, e.g., within caving the allowed sub-activities
      or cave types are Rock, Ice, Man-made, Science, and Equipment and
      within skiing they are Outdoor, Indoor, Snow, Sand, Rock, Ash,
      Asphalt, Grass, Mud, Plastic, Other-substances, and Imported-snow.
      This attribute is mandatory.

   u

      URL for the article.  This attribute is optional.  If no URL is
      known, the attribute should not be specified at all.

5.  Generation 1 Format

   Generation 0 format is similar to Generation 1 format, with the
   following differences:

   o  The "k" (city) field was not used.

   o  The "y" (year) and "m" (month) fields were not used.

6.  Compatibility

   All the formats are very similar.  The information content is the
   same, and the attributes about the activities are represented
   literally in the same way.  The only differences are some additional
   information in Generation 2 and Generation 1 formats, and the
   wrapping of entries in the GeoJSON objects in Generation 2 format vs.
   simply containing them in a list in Generations 1 and 2 formats.

   The Psgeo software library supports both [Psgeo], so existing files
   with content in Generation 1 format continue to be readable.

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


   For compatibility between generation 1 and 0, the differences are
   again supported by software libraries and any Generation 0 content
   continues to be acceptable by systems consuming Activity JSON.
