1.  Introduction

   ...

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC7159] is a popular format used
   in web applications.  GeoJSON [RFC7946] is a format for encoding a
   variety of geographic data structures using JSON.

2.  Normative Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Format

   The locations.json file is in JSON format.  It should be array of
   records.

   An empty file should contain just:

       []

   Here's an example of a file with just one entry:
