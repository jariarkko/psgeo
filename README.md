# Psgeo: Activity location library

Psgeo is a small Javascript library for managing and filtering
information for web applications that deal with, e.g., sports
activities in different locations. Its primary purpose is to be able
to display maps of activities at those different locations, while
allowing for smart filtering.

Psgeo has been used for tracking skiing activities by
[Planetskier](https://planetskier.net) and caving by
[Luolaseura](https://luolaseura.fi) and
[Planetcaver](https://planetcaver.net). For an example application,
see Ralf Strandell's [Finnish caves page](https://luolaseura.fi/luolakanta/kartta.html) at the on the Luolaseura web.

Psgeo is based on
[Activity JSON](https://github.com/jariarkko/psgeo/blob/master/doc/activity-json.txt),
a simple format that allows a server to provide information about
activities and their geographic positions to a web application running
in a browser.

For more information on the usage and API of Psgeo, read the
[Psgeo Usage Introduction](https://github.com/jariarkko/psgeo/blob/master/doc/Psgeo-Intro.md),

Psgeo was initially written by Jari Arkko, but there has also been
contributions by Ralf Strandell.
