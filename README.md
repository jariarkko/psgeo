# Psgeo: Activity location library

Psgeo is a small Javascript library for managing and filtering
information for web applications that deal with, e.g., sports
activities in different locations. Its primary purpose is to be able
to display maps of activities at those different locations, while
allowing for smart filtering.

Psgeo has been used for tracking skiing activities by
[Planetskier](https://planetskier.net) and caving by
[Luolaseura](https://luolaseura.fi) and [Planetcaver](https://planetcaver.net).

Psgeo is based on
[Activity JSON](https://github.com/jariarkko/psgeo/blob/master/doc/activity-json.txt),
a simple format that allows a server to provide information about
activities and their geographic positions to a web application running
in a browser.

Psgeo was initially written by Jari Arkko, but there has also been
contributions by Ralf Strandell.
